## Offshoring Tire Production

Suppose that Flamerock Tires must decide where to produce one million tires: the US, where wages are 30 and the cost of capital is 10; or China, where wages are 5 and the cost of capital is 25. Production in each location follows the same technology (production function) given by: 

$$Q = f(L, K) = L^{0.25} * K^{0.75}$$

1. Find the cost-minimizing input levels in each location to produce the goal of 1 million tires; 


2. Find the total cost in each location: which location minimizes costs?
