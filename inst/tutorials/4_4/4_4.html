<h2>Types of Asymmetric Information</h2>
<p>Asymmetric information occurs when one party in a transaction has
more or better information than the other party and is the result of
either <em>hidden characteristics</em> or <em>hidden actions</em>. We
will discuss two main types of asymmetric information: adverse selection
and moral hazard.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Adverse Selection:
<ul>
<li>Occurs before a transaction takes place.</li>
<li>Occurs because of hidden characteristics.</li>
<li>Results in only low-quality goods being available; high-quality
goods are driven out.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Moral Hazard:
<ul>
<li>Occurs after a transaction takes place.</li>
<li>Occurs because of hidden actions.</li>
<li>Results in one party taking advantage of the other party’s lack of
information.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="section-adverse-selection" class="section level2">
<h2>Adverse Selection</h2>
<p>Examples of adverse selection include:<br />
- <strong>Used car market:</strong> Sellers have more information about
the quality of the car than buyers.<br />
- <strong>Health insurance:</strong> Individuals have more information
about their health than insurance companies.<br />
- <strong>Job market:</strong> Employers have less information about the
skills and abilities of potential employees than the employees
themselves.<br />
- <strong>Credit market:</strong> Borrowers have more information about
their creditworthiness than lenders.</p>
<div id="section-adverse-selection-in-the-used-car-market"
class="section level3">
<h3>Adverse Selection in the Used Car Market</h3>
<p>Imagine a used-car market where there are 100 sellers and 100 buyers.
Each seller has a car that is either high-quality (H) or low-quality
(L). The seller knows the quality of the car, but the buyer does not.
Since the sellers are slightly less eager to keep a car of either type
than buyers are to buy one, they value each type of car is higher to the
buyers than it is to the sellers. To formalize this, suppose the
following values for each type of car to each type of agent:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V_{S} = \Bigg\{ \begin{align} &amp;
\$10,000 \text{ if the car is a &quot;lemon&quot;} \\ &amp; \$20,000
\text{ if the car is high-quality} \end{align}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V_{B} = \Bigg\{ \begin{align} &amp;
\$12,500 \text{ if the car is a &quot;lemon&quot;} \\ &amp; \$25,000
\text{ if the car is high-quality} \end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>Since the buyer does not know the quality of the car, any car they
might buy in this market has a 0.5 probability of being a high-quality
car and a 0.5 probability of being a lemon. However, the seller
<em>does</em> know the quality of the car, so the car they sell is worth
either <span class="math inline">\(\$10,000\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(\$20,000\)</span> to them with probability <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>
