## Oligopoly

### Characteristics of Oligopoly

1.  Few Large Producers (often one dominant firm)
2.  Products may be homogeneous or differentiated
3.  Mutual Interdependence (Some Control over Price)
4.  Barriers to Entry

### Basic Types of Oligopoly

## Stackelberg (Kinked Demand Curve) Oligopoly



## Review: A Simple Monopoly Example

Market (inverse) demand:

$$P = 10 - Q$$

Firm Costs: 

$$TC = 6Q$$

Solve for the monopoly equilibrium price and quantity. 

Suppose that the firms entered a legally-binding trust that enabled them to collude. What would the quantity of each individual firm be? 

### Solution

If you chose to try doing this using R (which you might not need to since demand, marginal revenue, and marginal cost are all linear), the code might look like this:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(MicroWithR)
Dinv = function(x) {
  10 - x
}
pi <- function(x) {
  Dinv(x)*x - 6*x
}
eq0 <- solnp2(
  pars = 1, 
  fun = pi, 
  LB = 0, 
  control = list(trace = 0), 
  max = TRUE
) 
p0 = Dinv(eq0$pars)
qi = eq0$pars/2
```

The total monopolist's quantity would be: 

$$(Q,P) = (`r eq0$pars`, `r p0`)$$

This makes each of the two firms' share of the total quantity: 

$$(Q_1, Q_2) = (`r eq0$pars/2`, `r eq0$pars/2`)$$ 

## Bertrand Duopoly

A Bertrand oligopoly is a "winner take all" market in which the firm that charges the lowest price "wins" the opportunity to supply the entire market. If there is a tie, then firms charging the lowest price split the quantity equally. 

$$Q_1 = D(P_1,P_2) = \Biggl\{ \matrix{0 \text{ if } P_1 > P_2 \\ Q/2 \text{ if } P_1 = P_2 \\ Q \text{ if } P_1 < P_2}$$

$$Q_2 = D(P_1,P_2) = \Biggl\{ \matrix{0 \text{ if } P_2 > P_1 \\ Q/2 \text{ if } P_2 = P_1 \\ Q \text{ if } P_2 < P_1}$$

### "Analytical" Solution

Four Non-Cases: 

1. $p_1 \ne p_2$ and $min\{p_1, p_2\} < MC$
2. $p_1 = p_2$ and $min\{p_1, p_2\} < MC$
3. $p_1 \ne p_2$ and $min\{p_1, p_2\} > MC$
4. $p_1 = p_2$ and $min\{p_1, p_2\} > MC$

Suppose two identical firms choose their price to maximize profits subject to a "winner take all" market structure. What will the profit-maximizing price of the winning firm(s) be?
